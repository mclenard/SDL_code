## Shapiro Design Lab code

This is the repository I'll use to keep versions of the scripts I've used while at the Shapiro Design Lab at UMich library. 

### RLB code

This is code relating to a pair of Zooniverse projects involving scans of La Brea tarpits dig notes.

### NAP code

These are scripts to convert exported Access database observation data from the Ann Arbor Natural Areas Preservation department to simple Darwin Core.
